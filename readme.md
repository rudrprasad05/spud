# SpudOS

SpudOS is a minimal operating system being built entirely from scratch using the C programming language. The goal of this project is to create a lightweight, efficient, and educational operating system.

## Current Components

- **Spud Shell**: A command-line interface for interacting with the operating system. This is being developed as part of the project.

## Development

This project is in its early stages, and more components will be added over time. The focus is on building everything from the ground up to gain a deeper understanding of operating system design.

## License

The licensing details for SpudOS will be added in the future.
